"Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.",
"Software design is just like house design. A good architect designs for your current needs, with an eye for future growth and renovation.",
"Software development is a collaborative effort, not a solo endeavor.",
"Software engineering is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers.",

"The best way to predict your future is to code it.",
"The code you write is the code you maintain.",
"The difference between a good programmer and a bad programmer is the amount of time it takes them to write code.",
"The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time.",
"The key to good programming is to always start with a clear understanding of the problem.",
"The key to writing good code is to write code that is easy to read.",
"The most important skill in programming is the ability to learn quickly.",
"The most important thing in the programming language is the name. A language will not succeed without a good name. I have recently invented a very good name and now I am looking for a suitable language.",
"The only constant in the software development lifecycle is change.",
"The only way to do great work is to love what you do.",
"The only way to go fast is to go well.",
"The perfect is the enemy of the good.",
"The sooner you start coding, the longer the program will take.",
"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.",
"There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.",
"There's nothing more permanent than a temporary hack.",
